# Changelog

## v0.0.1-alpha12

- Added Kiosk page filtering, visible/enabled counters and clearer enabled/disabled page badges.
- Added page duplicate, move up, move down and safer page removal with workflow index remapping.
- Added bulk enable/disable for all kiosk pages.
- Added check-all-pages with per-page reachability results.
- Added page import/export as JSON for faster multi-kiosk setup.
- Added browser start, stop and restart controls directly to the Kiosk page.
- Added Scheduler status cards for mode, reason, active rule and next switch.
- Added quick workflow tools to build rotation from enabled pages, clear rotation and clear time rules.
- Added a small recent-action history on the Kiosk page so button feedback remains visible after toasts disappear.

## v0.0.1-alpha11

- Redesigned the Kiosk page around the actual operator workflow: current page, primary page actions, page list and workflow board.
- Replaced the dense page table with clearer page cards and moved the selected page controls into the main status area.
- Added expandable sidebar groups for System and Settings with focused subpages.
- Split System into Actions, Hardware, Terminal and Logs.
- Split Settings into Access, Browser and Performance, Config and Maintenance.
- Moved SSH key handling into Settings Access and kept Terminal focused on command execution.

## v0.0.1-alpha10

- Refactored the Admin UI navigation around the real operating areas: Dashboard, Kiosk, MQTT, System and Settings.
- Reworked the Kiosk page into a page and workflow control center with page activation, reachability checks, rotation durations and time rules in one place.
- Moved browser engine, browser arguments, GPU, performance profile and watchdog settings into Settings.
- Merged hardware controls, privileged actions, terminal and logs into the System page.
- Added stored NTP server and timezone settings to prepare time alignment with Home Assistant installations.
- Replaced the embedded page preview with an external-open action because Home Assistant dashboards commonly block iframe previews.

## v0.0.1-alpha1

- Started KioskMate as a clean Go-based kiosk supervisor project.
- Removed the legacy Electron application from the repository.
- Added the `kioskmate` daemon, embedded Admin UI, browser supervisor, watchdog, MQTT discovery and updater.
