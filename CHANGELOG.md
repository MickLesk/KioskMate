# Changelog

## v0.0.1-alpha10

- Refactored the Admin UI navigation around the real operating areas: Dashboard, Kiosk, MQTT, System and Settings.
- Reworked the Kiosk page into a page and workflow control center with page activation, reachability checks, rotation durations and time rules in one place.
- Moved browser engine, browser arguments, GPU, performance profile and watchdog settings into Settings.
- Merged hardware controls, privileged actions, terminal and logs into the System page.
- Added stored NTP server and timezone settings to prepare time alignment with Home Assistant installations.
- Replaced the embedded page preview with an external-open action because Home Assistant dashboards commonly block iframe previews.

- Added the `kioskmate` daemon, embedded Admin UI, browser supervisor, watchdog, MQTT discovery and updater.
