# Changelog

## v0.0.1-alpha16

- Added optional separate browser profiles per kiosk page to isolate Home Assistant sessions and cookies.
- Added Admin UI and MQTT switch support for separate page sessions.
- Made performance profiles affect Chromium flags instead of only storing a config value.
- Added `minimal` and `quality` profiles to the Admin UI and aligned UI/MQTT/profile validation.
- Added improved MQTT discovery publish feedback with discovery prefix, root topic, page count and page entity count.
- Added tests for isolated page profile paths and performance profile Chromium arguments.

## v0.0.1-alpha15

- Added watchdog diagnostics to browser status, including pressure, limits, last restart and last restart reason.
- Raised Raspberry safe-mode watchdog limits from 700 MB / 160% to 1200 MB / 220% with automatic migration for the old alpha values.
- Added a HA session repair action that resets the browser session and immediately checks the active page.
- Added watchdog diagnostics to the Dashboard and Kiosk pages.
- Added Home Assistant MQTT discovery/state for browser start time, watchdog pressure, watchdog limits, watchdog last restart/reason and page indexes.
- Added watchdog details and log paths to browser diagnostics.

## v0.0.1-alpha14

- Added a dedicated browser log file at `~/.config/kioskmate/logs/browser.log`.
- Extended Admin UI logs with selectable sources: combined, core, browser, systemd journal, service status and paths.
- Improved log fallback behavior for user sessions where `journalctl --user` has no entries.
- Added service/config/log path output to the Logs page for faster Raspberry Pi troubleshooting.
- Kept browser stdout and stderr in both the service output and browser log file.

## v0.0.1-alpha13

- Added one Home Assistant MQTT button entity per enabled kiosk page so automations can switch directly to a specific page.
- Added per-page MQTT active binary sensors plus diagnostic page name and URL sensors.
- Added MQTT command topics under `pages/<page_id>/activate` for direct page switching.
- Added stable page entity IDs with duplicate-name handling.
- Added the HA session reset action directly to the Kiosk page.
- Added Chromium feature disables for local network access checks that can interfere with local Home Assistant dashboards.
- Improved Kiosk page checks with a clear HTTP 403 Home Assistant IP-ban/session hint.

## v0.0.1-alpha12

- Added Kiosk page filtering, visible/enabled counters and clearer enabled/disabled page badges.
- Added page duplicate, move up, move down and safer page removal with workflow index remapping.
- Added bulk enable/disable for all kiosk pages.
- Added check-all-pages with per-page reachability results.
- Added page import/export as JSON for faster multi-kiosk setup.
- Added browser start, stop and restart controls directly to the Kiosk page.
- Added Scheduler status cards for mode, reason, active rule and next switch.
- Added quick workflow tools to build rotation from enabled pages, clear rotation and clear time rules.
- Added a small recent-action history on the Kiosk page so button feedback remains visible after toasts disappear.

## v0.0.1-alpha11

- Redesigned the Kiosk page around the actual operator workflow: current page, primary page actions, page list and workflow board.
- Replaced the dense page table with clearer page cards and moved the selected page controls into the main status area.
- Added expandable sidebar groups for System and Settings with focused subpages.
- Split System into Actions, Hardware, Terminal and Logs.
- Split Settings into Access, Browser and Performance, Config and Maintenance.
- Moved SSH key handling into Settings Access and kept Terminal focused on command execution.

## v0.0.1-alpha10

- Refactored the Admin UI navigation around the real operating areas: Dashboard, Kiosk, MQTT, System and Settings.
- Reworked the Kiosk page into a page and workflow control center with page activation, reachability checks, rotation durations and time rules in one place.
- Moved browser engine, browser arguments, GPU, performance profile and watchdog settings into Settings.
- Merged hardware controls, privileged actions, terminal and logs into the System page.
- Added stored NTP server and timezone settings to prepare time alignment with Home Assistant installations.
- Replaced the embedded page preview with an external-open action because Home Assistant dashboards commonly block iframe previews.

## v0.0.1-alpha1

- Started KioskMate as a clean Go-based kiosk supervisor project.
- Removed the legacy Electron application from the repository.
- Added the `kioskmate` daemon, embedded Admin UI, browser supervisor, watchdog, MQTT discovery and updater.
- Added Debian packaging for `arm64` and `amd64`.
- Added root-level CI and release workflows for `v0*` tags.
